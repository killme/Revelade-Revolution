Revelade Revolution is a post-apocalyptic zombie survival game, you have limited health and ammo that you must use to survive against herds of zombies that get tougher every round.

You can also play the game locally or online in a variety of modes including Free for all, Capture the flag, Infection, Survival, Invasion, Coop edit and many more on any of the many maps available, using the player class of your choice.

Background:

Revelade is a virus in the form of a drug which causes human gene degradation. A secret organization was working on a developing an improved version of revelade, and they succeeded.

Unfortunately, the organization was infiltrated and the drug was stolen. Every government agency in the world was put on high alert. Little did they know that the drug was highly contagious and was already being distributed in the water reserviors of every major city in the world.

On March 15, 2022, the world as we know it was over. Nuclear weapons became in fashion, hundreds of cities were destroyed, but to no avail. The virus had already spread into the majority of human population and it was just a matter of time. Everyone knew apocalypse was near.

The human gene had degraded so much that every human being on the planet turned into a zombie, well almost everyone.
There was small group of survivors who called themselves The Forgotten Ones, these survivors seem to posses immunity against this virus, but no one knows the secret behind it. Now their duty is to withhold their bases long enough for them to regenerate and create an immune generation which in turn will take back the world and restore the human civilization to the way it was.

Are you up to the task of saving the world?

Revelade Revolution is based on Cube 2: Sauerbraten and is compatible with Sauerbraten maps.
