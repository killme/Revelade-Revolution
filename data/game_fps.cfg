They create other bots identical to themselves if they can find tools and materials, so the result is a robotic counter-epidemic. Their fighting abilities are comparable to that of a trained human and several dishonest groups have managed to reprogram them to do their bidding. These are sometimes called "Bandit Bots" by other survivors. Many people believe that if it weren't for the Kosse Bot, humans would be entirely extinct.]
