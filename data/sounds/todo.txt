replace fx/ctf with new sounds
(these have been "borrowed from AssaultCube, with permission from Makke to reuse in Sauerbraten", we may need permission to use them in RR too)

replace fx/splosh(2/3).ogg with new sounds
review fx/press.ogg
(these three are taken from Red Eclipse, I'm not sure if we can use them)

puopulate voice/radio
(we may need a voice actor for this, who could also record new voices for capture mode)


I've reviewed all the lisences I could find and I think we're fine, with the above exceptions.
